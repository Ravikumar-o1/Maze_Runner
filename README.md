   The Project is based the Backtracking Algorithm

  The maze contains the different locations. We have to find the path for the mouse to reach the destination .
  
   The solution involves the recursion where we have to pass to each every path possible in the maze . The backtracking is perform when
   the path traverse is found to be the invalid . The stack  can be use to keep the status of previous states so that we  can move to
   another path. This invloves the exploring the all the point int the maze to reach the destination.
