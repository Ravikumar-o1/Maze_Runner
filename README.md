The Project is based the Backtracking Algorithm

  The maze contains the different locations. We have to find the path for the mouse to reach the destination .

  
    Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time (by time, here, is referred to the time elapsed till reaching any level of the search tree).
